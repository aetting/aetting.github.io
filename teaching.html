<h2>Teaching</h2>

<h3>Undergraduate</h3>
<p><b>Spring 2017: "Meaning in Language: Brains and Machines"</b> (LING449R) </p>
<p> I designed and led this course independently, teaching a class of 16 undergraduates from linguistics and computer science. The course explored the concept of "meaning" from perspectives of linguistics, cognitive neuroscience of language, and natural language processing. <a href="449R-syllabus.pdf">[Syllabus]</a></p>
<p><b>Fall 2015: "Computational Approaches in Language Science"</b> (CMSC289J/LING499J)<p>
<p>I served as TA for this course, in addition to designing and teaching a five-class segment on meaning and vector space models. This course also served both linguistics and computer science students. <a href="499J-syllabus.pdf">[Syllabus]</a></p>
<p><b>Fall 2014: "Language and Mind"</b> (LING240)</p>
<p>I served as TA for this course, which is an Intro to Linguistics course for linguistics majors. <a href="240-syllabus.pdf">[Syllabus]</a></p>
<h3>Graduate</h3>

<p><b>Winter Storm workshop</b></p>
<p>For two years I also led the organization of the annual <a href="https://languagescience.umd.edu/winter-storm" target="_blank">Winter Storm</a> graduate training workshop, designing a two-week graduate training curriculum targeting key research skills, professional development, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

<p>During one of these workshops I led a two-week morning session on science communication. </p>
