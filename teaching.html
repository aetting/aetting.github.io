<h3>University of Chicago</h3>
<p><b>Fall 2019: "Computational Linguistics I"</b> (LING 28610/ LING 38610 / CMSC 25610 / CMSC 35610)</p>
<p>Mixed graduate/undergraduate introduction to topics at the intersection of computation and language, oriented toward linguists and cognitive scientists. We will study computational linguistics from both scientific and engineering angles -- the use of computational modeling to address scientific questions in linguistics and cognitive science, as well as the design of computational systems to solve engineering problems in natural language processing (NLP). <a href="syllabi/syllabus_CL1_F19.pdf">[Syllabus]</a></p>
<p><b>Winter 2020: "Computational Linguistics II"</b> (LING 28620 / LING 38620 / CMSC 25620 / CMSC 35620)<p>
<p>The second in two-course sequence providing an introduction to topics at the intersection of computation and language, oriented toward linguists and cognitive scientists. In this quarter we will cover more advanced topics in cognitive/linguistic modeling and natural language processing (NLP), applying more complex programming and mathematical foundations. <a href="syllabi/syllabus_CL2_W20.pdf">[Syllabus]</a></p>
<p><b>Spring 2020: "Seminar: Computational Linguistics"</b> (LING 58600) </p>
<p> In this course we will examine approaches to meaning in computational linguistics -- particularly, efforts to capture meaning and "understanding" in artificial intelligence. <a href="syllabi/syllabus_CLsem_S20.pdf">[Syllabus]</a></p>


<h3>University of Maryland</h3>
<p><b>Spring 2017: "Meaning in Language: Brains and Machines"</b> (LING449R) </p>
<p> I designed and led this course independently, teaching a class of 16 undergraduates from linguistics and computer science. The course explored the concept of "meaning" from perspectives of linguistics, cognitive neuroscience of language, and natural language processing. <a href="syllabi/449R-syllabus.pdf">[Syllabus]</a></p>
<p><b>Fall 2015: "Computational Approaches in Language Science"</b> (CMSC289J/LING499J)<p>
<p>I served as TA for this course, in addition to designing and teaching a five-class segment on meaning and vector space models. This course also served both linguistics and computer science students. <a href="syllabi/499J-syllabus.pdf">[Syllabus]</a></p>
<p><b>Fall 2014: "Language and Mind"</b> (LING240)</p>
<p>I served as TA for this course, which is an Intro to Linguistics course for linguistics majors. <a href="syllabi/240-syllabus.pdf">[Syllabus]</a></p>

<p><b>Winter Storm workshop</b></p>
<p>For two years I led the organization of the annual <a href="https://languagescience.umd.edu/winter-storm" target="_blank">Winter Storm</a> graduate training workshop, designing a two-week graduate training curriculum targeting key research skills, professional development, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

<p>During one of these workshops I led a two-week morning session on science communication. </p>
